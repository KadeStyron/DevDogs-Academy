## Including DevDogs on Your Resume

When adding your involvement with **DevDogs**, it's essential to use a well-structured resume format that clearly communicates your skills and experience. A good resume template can make your accomplishments stand out, especially when it comes to open-source contributions and teamwork in tech-related clubs.

### Start with a Strong Resume Template

If you're unsure where to find one, a great resource is the [UGA Career Center's Technical Resume](https://career.uga.edu/resume_examples). This template is pretty standard and designed to highlight your technical skills while maintaining a clean, readable format. Additionally, OverLeaf has a bunch of good [templates](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv) you can browse through.



### Quantify Your Impact

DevDogs gives out contribution points and leader board spots which provides great quantitative statistics. For example, "Ranked #3 on the DevDogs contribution leader board for the 2024 project, **UGA Optimized Schedule Builder**, by contributing 200+ lines of code and resolving 10 issues." Quantifying your contributions gives a clearer picture of the value you’ve brought to the project and stands out to employers.
